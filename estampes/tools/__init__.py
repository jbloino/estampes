"""Module with different tools to facilitate data operations in ESTAMPES

This module provides different simple tools, by submodules to facilitate
  common operations like conversions, transformations...
The tools are gathered by submodules based on their intended use:
`atom`
    Atom-specific tools.
`comp`
    Related to basic software/computing operations (ex: mem. units).
`math`
    Simple math functions.
`vib`
    Related to vibrations, for instance eigenvectors orientations.

See submodules for details.
